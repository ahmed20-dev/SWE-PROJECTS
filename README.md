# Software Engineering Journey

> **From beginner to professional Full-Stack + AI Engineer.**

This repository documents my journey from learning programming fundamentals to becoming a professional software engineer.

It serves as **proof of work**: a record of what I learn, what I build, the problems I solve, the engineering decisions I make, and how my skills develop over time.

---

## 🎯 Goal

My goal is to become a **Full-Stack + AI Engineer** capable of:

* Building production-quality software independently
* Designing and developing complete applications
* Building reliable backend systems and APIs
* Designing and working with databases
* Developing modern frontend applications
* Deploying and maintaining applications
* Applying software engineering principles
* Designing scalable systems
* Building and integrating AI/ML systems
* Qualifying for professional software engineering roles

---
## My Learning Strategy

My long-term goal is to become a Full-Stack + AI Engineer capable
of building complete AI-powered products.

I am developing this through two complementary tracks:

### Track 1 — Software Engineering

Build the engineering foundation required to create and deploy
complete software systems.

Python → Databases → Backend → Frontend → DevOps → System Design

### Track 2 — Data Science & Machine Learning

Develop the data and ML knowledge required to build and integrate
intelligent systems.

Python → Data Analysis → Machine Learning → ML Projects

### Long-Term Goal

Combine both tracks to build:

Data + ML
    +
Backend + Database
    +
Frontend
    +
Deployment
    ↓
Full-Stack AI Systems

---

## Phase 2: Computer Science (5–8 weeks)

### 1. Data Structures & Algorithms

Learn: Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Heaps, Hash Tables, Trees, Graphs, Sorting, Searching, Recursion, Dynamic Programming

-  Tries — common in autocomplete/search features and some LLM tokenizer discussions

Practice: LeetCode, HackerRank

Goal: Solve ~150–250 problems.

**🛠 Projects:**

- Implement each core data structure from scratch (linked list, stack, queue, hash table, BST, graph) before relying on built-ins
- Build a simple autocomplete engine using a Trie
- Build a "six degrees of separation" search over a small graph (BFS/DFS practice)

---

## Phase 3: Databases (2–4 weeks)

## Table of Contents
- [Phase 1: SQL Fundamentals](#phase-1-sql-fundamentals)
- [Phase 2: PostgreSQL Specifics](#phase-2-postgresql-specifics)
- [Phase 3: NoSQL & Specialized Stores](#phase-3-nosql--specialized-stores)

---

## Phase 1: SQL Fundamentals

**Master:**
- [ ] SELECT, JOIN (inner, left, right, full, self-join), GROUP BY, HAVING
- [ ] Subqueries (correlated and uncorrelated)
- [ ] CTEs (`WITH` clauses), including recursive CTEs
- [ ] Window functions (`ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, `LAG`/`LEAD`, running totals, partitions)
- [ ] Transactions (`BEGIN`/`COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK`) and isolation levels — read committed, repeatable read, serializable. Understand what a race condition or phantom read actually looks like, not just the definitions.
- [ ] Indexes — what they are, B-tree vs other types, when they help vs hurt

**Add explicitly (often skipped):**
- [ ] `EXPLAIN` / `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` — read a query plan, spot a sequential scan where an index scan should be happening, understand cost estimates. This is the single most transferable skill in this entire roadmap.

---

## Phase 2: PostgreSQL Specifics

**Learn:**
- [ ] Schema design principles
- [ ] Constraints (`PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, `UNIQUE`, `CHECK`, `NOT NULL`)
- [ ] Relationships (1:1, 1:many, many:many, junction tables)
- [ ] Normalization (1NF → 3NF, and knowing when to deliberately denormalize)
- [ ] Query optimization in practice (using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` from Phase 1 against real queries)
- [ ] Backup/restore (`pg_dump`, `pg_restore`, point-in-time recovery basics)

**Add explicitly (often skipped):**
- [ ] Connection pooling (PgBouncer or equivalent) — every real app hits this wall eventually, especially serverless or AI apps that open lots of short-lived connections. Understand transaction vs session pooling modes.
- [ ] Migrations (Alembic, Flyway, or hand-rolled versioned SQL files) — schema design is only half the story; you need a repeatable, safe way to evolve a schema that already has data and traffic on it.

---

## Phase 3: NoSQL & Specialized Stores

- [ ] **Redis** — caching, rate limiting, session storage, pub/sub. Understand cache invalidation strategies (TTL, write-through, write-behind), not just "cache it."
- [ ] **MongoDB or similar (document store)** — at least conceptually. Understand where a document model fits better than relational (nested/variable-shape data) and where it doesn't (highly relational data with lots of joins).
- [ ] **Vector databases** (pgvector, Pinecone, Qdrant, or Weaviate) — the layer your AI stack actually runs on for RAG and semantic search.
  - [ ] HNSW vs IVFFlat index tradeoffs (build time, query speed, recall)
  - [ ] Distance metrics (cosine vs L2 vs inner product) — picking the wrong one silently degrades search quality without throwing any errors

---

## 🛠 Projects

- [ ] **Schema design & queries** — Design and normalize a schema for a real domain (library system, e-commerce store, etc.), populate it, then write increasingly complex queries: JOINs → window functions → CTEs. *Extension:* once populated, force a migration (add a relationship, split a table) as if it were live in production.
- [ ] **Redis caching** — Add Redis caching in front of a slow query and measure the speedup with `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` before/after. Include a cache invalidation strategy, not just the cache itself.
- [ ] **pgvector similarity search** — Store a handful of text documents as embeddings in pgvector and run a similarity search query. *Extension:* try a bad chunking/embedding strategy and observe how search quality degrades.


## Phase 4: Backend Development (6–8 weeks)

## Table of Contents
- [1. REST APIs](#1-rest-apis)
- [2. FastAPI](#2-fastapi)
- [3. Authentication](#3-authentication)
- [4. Testing](#4-testing)
- [5. Security Fundamentals](#5-security-fundamentals)

---

## 1. REST APIs

**Learn:**
- [ ] HTTP fundamentals (methods, headers, status codes)
- [ ] JSON, CRUD, REST principles
- [ ] Status codes (2xx/3xx/4xx/5xx — used correctly, not just 200/404)
- [ ] Pagination (offset vs cursor-based)
- [ ] Validation

**Add explicitly:**
- [ ] GraphQL basics — just enough to know when it's the right tool vs REST
- [ ] Idempotency & rate limiting

---

## 2. FastAPI

**Learn:**
- [ ] Routing
- [ ] Pydantic models
- [ ] Validation
- [ ] Dependency Injection
- [ ] Background Tasks
- [ ] Middleware
- [ ] Async programming (`async`/`await`, when it actually helps vs adds complexity)

**Add explicitly:**
- [ ] WebSockets — needed for streaming LLM responses to a frontend
- [ ] Server-Sent Events (SSE) — the more common pattern for token streaming

---

## 3. Authentication

**Learn:**
- [ ] Sessions, Cookies
- [ ] JWT
- [ ] OAuth
- [ ] Password hashing (bcrypt/argon2, salting)
- [ ] Authorization, RBAC

**Add explicitly:**
- [ ] API key management — how you'll gate access to your own AI endpoints

---

## 4. Testing

*(deeper than Phase 1 basics)*

- [ ] Unit tests (pytest)
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] Mocking external APIs
- [ ] Test coverage tools

---

## 5. Security Fundamentals

- [ ] OWASP Top 10 basics
- [ ] SQL injection
- [ ] XSS
- [ ] CSRF
- [ ] Secrets management (env vars, vaults)
- [ ] Input sanitization — especially important with LLMs (prompt injection is the SQL injection of the AI era)

---

## 🛠 Projects

- [ ] **CRUD REST API** — Build a full CRUD REST API (notes app or bookstore API) with Postgres + FastAPI, fully validated with Pydantic.
- [ ] **Auth + RBAC** — Add JWT-based auth and RBAC (admin vs regular user roles) to that API.
- [ ] **Rate limiting + pagination** — Add Redis-backed rate limiting and pagination to the endpoints.
- [ ] **Test suite** — Write a pytest suite with mocked external calls and get meaningful coverage.
- [ ] **Streaming endpoint** — Add a WebSocket or SSE endpoint that streams fake "typed" text, character by character — a direct rehearsal for streaming LLM output later.

### 2. React

Learn: Components, Hooks, Routing, Context, State Management

### 3. Next.js

Learn: App Router, Server Components, API Routes, SSR, SSG

-  Streaming UI patterns (rendering tokens as they arrive from an LLM)

**🛠 Projects:**

- A static portfolio site (HTML/CSS/JS only, no framework) — forces you to understand the fundamentals
- A React front-end for the CRUD API you built in Phase 4 (login, list, create, edit, delete)
- Rebuild that front-end in Next.js with the App Router, adding SSR for a public page and a protected dashboard route
- A chat-style UI component that renders streamed text token-by-token from your Phase 4 SSE endpoint

---

## Phase 6: DevOps (3–5 weeks)

### 1. Docker

Images, Containers, Docker Compose, Volumes, Networking

### 2. Deployment

Deploy to: Render, Railway, Fly.io, DigitalOcean, AWS (later)
Learn: Nginx, HTTPS, Environment variables, CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

###  3. Observability

- Logging (structured logs)
- Monitoring/metrics (Prometheus/Grafana or hosted equivalent)
- Error tracking (Sentry)
- **LLM-specific observability** (token usage, latency, cost tracking — LangSmith/Helicone)

**🛠 Projects:**

- Dockerize the Phase 4 API + Postgres + Redis with a single `docker-compose.yml`
- Set up a GitHub Actions pipeline that runs tests on every push and deploys on merge to `main`
- Deploy the full stack (API + frontend + DB) live on Render or Fly.io with HTTPS
- Add structured logging + Sentry error tracking + a basic Grafana dashboard to the deployed app

---

## Phase 7: System Design (3–4 weeks)

Do this right after Phase 4, while backend concepts are fresh.

Learn:

- Scalability basics: vertical vs horizontal scaling
- Load balancing
- Caching strategies (cache invalidation, CDN, Redis caching layers)
- Database scaling (replication, sharding, read replicas)
- Message queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka, or SQS) — async job processing, decoupling services
- Microservices vs monolith trade-offs
- API Gateway pattern
- Consistency models (CAP theorem, eventual consistency)
- Rate limiting & throttling design
- Designing for failure (circuit breakers, retries, timeouts, graceful degradation)
-  AI-specific system design: RAG pipelines, scalable LLM inference services, recommendation systems

Resources: "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" (book), ByteByteGo, System Design Primer (GitHub)

**🛠 Projects:**

- Add a message queue (e.g. Redis Queue or RabbitMQ) to your Phase 4 API for a slow task (e.g. sending emails, processing images) — turn a synchronous endpoint into an async job
- Write a full system design doc (with diagrams) for a URL shortener or rate limiter, then actually implement the rate limiter
- Write a system design doc specifically for a RAG-based Q&A service — this becomes your blueprint for Phase 8

---

## Phase 8: The AI Engineering Layer (6–10 weeks)

### Track A: Applied AI / LLM Engineering (do this first)

- How LLMs work conceptually (tokens, context windows, embeddings, attention)
- Prompt engineering fundamentals (few-shot, chain-of-thought, structured outputs)
- Using LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, open-source via Hugging Face/Ollama)
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: chunking strategies, embeddings, vector search, reranking
- **Agents & tool use**: function calling, agentic loops, orchestration (LangChain, LlamaIndex, or your own)
- Structured output / JSON mode, validation with Pydantic
- Fine-tuning basics (when to fine-tune vs prompt vs RAG)
- Evaluation of LLM outputs (automated evals, LLM-as-judge, golden datasets)
- Cost & latency optimization (caching, model selection, batching, streaming)
- Guardrails: prompt injection defense, output filtering, PII handling

### Track B: Core ML Foundations (optional, for deeper AI credibility)

- Python ML stack: NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn
- Supervised vs unsupervised learning basics
- Neural network fundamentals (forward/backward pass, gradient descent)
- Basics of transformer architecture
- PyTorch basics
- MLOps basics: model versioning, experiment tracking (MLflow/W&B), model serving

**🛠 Projects:**

- Build a RAG chatbot over your own PDFs/notes, using the pgvector setup from Phase 3
- Wire that RAG chatbot into your Phase 4 FastAPI backend as a proper API endpoint, streamed to the Phase 5 frontend via SSE
- Build an agent that can call your own CRUD API's endpoints as "tools" (e.g. "add a task called X" via natural language)
- Write an eval script that scores your RAG chatbot's answers against a small golden dataset
- Track A capstone: take one of your earlier full-stack projects (e.g. the bookstore/notes app) and bolt on a real AI feature — semantic search, AI summarization, or an AI assistant — end to end, deployed
- (Track B, optional) Fine-tune a small open-source model on a toy dataset and serve it locally with Ollama
